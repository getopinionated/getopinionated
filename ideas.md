Gameification
=============
3 aspects:
- Make total power visible to the world
- Social coins (stable income, reward real value judged by community)
- show the growth of the total project (as a cathedral), and show the user's own influence in this cathedral

Target the three groups respectively
- external politicians
- individuals
- community as a whole

How to engage user
- believable feedback (cfr Bibber calculator). The user needs to know you're not lying
- needs to know how to optimize naturally (Bibber moar)
- You need to believe you can do it (You can bibber, but not climb mnt everest)

Reward speedy replies!

Voting system
=============
Give accounts to organizations
- have no vote, but can receive delegations
- are controlled by a user

Viscous democracy
- decaying through proxies
